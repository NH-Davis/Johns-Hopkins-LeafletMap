This is an R Markdown document designed to create a simple webpage using Leaflet that includes a map of Paris which highlights the location of the Eiffel Tower, along with the date and time of the webpage's creation.

```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(leaflet)

# Set global chunk options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap tiles
  setView(lng = 2.2945, lat = 48.8584, zoom = 16) %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = 2.2945, lat = 48.8584, popup = "Eiffel Tower")

format(Sys.time(), "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")


```
